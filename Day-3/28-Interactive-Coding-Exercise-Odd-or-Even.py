Instructions

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

6 รท 2 = 3 with no remainder.

if number_to_test % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.\n")

    print("This is an odd number.\n")
